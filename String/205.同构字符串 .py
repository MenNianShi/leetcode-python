# Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
#
# Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
#
# All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.
#
# For example,
# Given "egg", "add", return true.
#
# Given "foo", "bar", return false.
#
# Given "paper", "title", return true.
#判断；两个字符串是不是同构的，即一个字符串的字母进行一一对应的替换可变成另一个字符串
