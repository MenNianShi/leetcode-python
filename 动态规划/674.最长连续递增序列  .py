# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3.
# Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.
# Example 2:
# Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
