# Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [3, 2, 1]
#
# Output: 1
#
# Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
# Example 2:
# Input: [1, 2]
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
# Example 3:
# Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]
#
# Output: 1
#
# Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
# Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
