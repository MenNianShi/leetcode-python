# Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.
#
# Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
# Output: True
# Example 2:
# Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
# Output: False
# 贪心算法（Greedy Algorithm）
#
# 从左向右遍历flowerbed，将满足要求的0设为1。计数与n比较即可。
