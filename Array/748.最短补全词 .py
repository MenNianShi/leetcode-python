# In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.
#
# Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.
#
# If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x,
# 6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.
